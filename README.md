#About Me

The best way to describe myself is a CG hobbyist. My day job is mostly related to distributed systems and backend engineering, but in my evenings I like to tinker on small CG projects just for fun. I am generally interested in rendering beautiful images often using offline rendering. I like to understand how complex materials work and I tend to spend too much time profiling and optimizing the code I write.

Here are some of the projects I made over the past 6 years:

##Raytracing in a Weekend book series

Peter Shirley's [Raytracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) books was the starting point to my little adventure. I've always played around with ray tracers and computer graphics but these books allowed me to build a decent render while learning the basics along the way. Eventually I rewrote the renderers in CUDA (several times) increasing its performance along the way.
